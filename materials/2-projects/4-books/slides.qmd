## Your Turn {.your-turn}

Let's turn the Stat 20 notes into a book.

1. Click into `book`.
2. Run `quarto create-project --type book`
3. Modify `_quarto.yml` to be sure all notes are added as [chapters](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html#overview).
4. Publish it! `quarto publish`
5. Add an icon to your website [sidebar](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html#sidebar-tools)
6. Create a [crossreference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) *between* chapters (add a reference to a figure from chapter 2 in chapter 4.)
